# Futy

Futy is a mobile application built using **Expo** and **React Native**. It is styled for an engaging user experience with dynamic UI interactions.

## Features

- **Expandable Search Bar**: 
  - The search icon in the navigation bar expands smoothly when clicked, allowing users to input their queries seamlessly.
- **Interactive Hamburger Menu**: 
  - The hamburger menu vibrates slightly and makes a click sound upon interaction, providing tactile feedback to the user.
- **Scrollable Cards with Bottom Bar Auto-Hide**:
  - The cards in the app are scrollable, and as the user scrolls, the bottom navigation bar hides automatically. This ensures users can view all cards without any interruptions.
